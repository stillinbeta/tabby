Tabby is (will be) server-side multi-protocol chat client for Android, using (hopefully)
strong encryption and security to safeguard your data.


Tabby is currently in the design phase. Take a look at /architecture to get an idea of what
I'm trying to build:
- architecture.svg is a overview of how the components will interact. Technology list is not final.
- security.svg describes how data will be protected throughout the various parts of the system
- workflows.md is a description of how the system will perform various actions.

There's currently no ETA, building complex distributed systems *and* an Android app is no
small undertaking for side project. Progress will be posted here.
